# Cluster Protocol v1 operational lifecycle

This contract adds operational `update` and `stop` controls to an admitted run. The Rust protocol
types are authoritative. The deterministic testkit backend proves the state machine and durable
records; it is not a native graph scheduler, worker executor, or process-freezing runtime.

## Initialize capabilities

`initialize` returns `capabilities.graphProfiles`, a deterministic, duplicate-free array of
supported graph profiles in canonical ascending order (`openengine.graph.full/v1` before
`openengine.graph.single-worker/v1`). The default is an empty array: a backend advertises a
profile only once its own certification issue upgrades its production factory to claim that
profile. Testkit-scripted capability vectors exist to verify wire shape and dispatcher plumbing;
they make no production claim about any backend's actual conformance.

## Update

`update({labels?, logLevel?, suspended?, ifGeneration, idempotencyKey})` requires at least one
operational field. `labels` is a complete replacement map with at most 64 bounded key/value pairs;
`logLevel` is one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`; `suspended` is boolean. The closed
request rejects graph, input, policy, worker, null, and unknown fields. Update preserves the graph,
compiled identity, root input, generation, run ID, and admission cursor.

Suspension is a durable dispatch gate, not a process freeze. It denies every new successor permit
but leaves existing leases alive. An existing black-box call may finish while suspended and append
its verified output. Resume returns the gate to `active`, after which successor dispatch continues
from the latest durable cursor.

## Stop

`stop({mode, ifGeneration, idempotencyKey})` accepts `drain` or `force`.

- Drain closes the dispatch gate and waits for every existing lease. The final verified completion
  atomically appends the single terminal `finished` record. With no in-flight lease, stop finishes
  immediately. Drain invokes no `onComplete` or other hook absent from the authored graph contract.
- Force closes the gate, signals every lease cancellation token, records each cancelled turn as
  structural void state with no outcome, and appends the single terminal `finished` record. A force
  request escalates an existing drain; a drain request never downgrades force.

The terminal `finished` record is the last lifecycle event. Late dispatch, completion, update, and
new stop mutations are rejected without appending lifecycle or verified-I/O records. Exact replay
of a previously accepted idempotency key remains available and cannot append a second terminal
record.

## Retry

`retry({ifGeneration, idempotencyKey})` is the single authoritative same-run manual retry. Unlike
`update` and `stop`, `retry` carries no turn, input, or other execution selector: the server always
targets its own store-tracked latest unconsumed failed dispatch frontier. A closed request rejects
`mode`, `turnId`, `executionId`, `session`, `workspacePath`, `provider`, and any other unknown field.

Only a pending failed frontier admits retry. Every other observable state fails closed with
`NO_RETRYABLE_FRONTIER` and a `reason`: `exhausted` (no turn has ever failed), `success` (the
frontier turn already completed), `active` (a turn is currently leased — either the original turn
or a superseding dispatch), or `consumed` (the frontier was already retried). A stale generation
returns `GENERATION_CONFLICT`; a terminal graph or a non-`active` dispatch state (suspended,
draining, force-stopping, stopped) returns `INVALID_PHASE`.

Retry reuses the exact recorded verified input, admitted target, workspace policy, and deadline of
the original run; it never accepts caller-supplied replacement data and never allocates a new run
ID or generation. It mints one new internal turn identity for the retried attempt and atomically
races any competing error-successor continuation: a concurrent new dispatch (`acquire_dispatch`)
silently supersedes — clears — a pending failed frontier it did not consume, so at most one side of
that race ever wins the frontier. Retry is a same-run intent record only; it does not itself
establish a new dispatch lease or invoke a worker, and no automatic or background code path in this
protocol ever calls it.

## CAS, idempotency, and acknowledgements

All three mutation methods require an exact generation CAS. Fingerprints bind the method and
canonical validated parameters except `idempotencyKey`. Same-key replay returns the original
receipt with `deduped:true`; changed parameters or cross-method key reuse returns
`IDEMPOTENCY_REUSE`.

Stop receipts acknowledge the accepted mode, effective monotonic mode, and durable lifecycle
state. They do not claim that external side effects were rolled back, that cancellation made an
already-started call side-effect-free, or that a worker never observed the request. Force prevents
late output from becoming verified protocol output; it cannot undo effects outside this protocol.

## Status and fixture boundary

Admitted status includes labels, log level, dispatch state, optional stop mode, and in-flight count.
The resource phase remains `running` during active, suspended, and draining operation and becomes
`finished` exactly once. `InMemoryAdmissionStore` serializes admission and lifecycle mutations under
one mutex solely for deterministic conformance tests. Scripted `running` and `finished` states do
not imply native node execution or production cancellation.
