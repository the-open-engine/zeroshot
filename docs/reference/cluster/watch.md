# Durable watch

The durable observation contract covers retained per-run events, opaque cursors, generic
subscription framing, and snapshot-tail reconnect. Rust wire types are authoritative, and this page
also specifies the in-process Rust client/server behavior. Shared connection, session, and
subscription machinery lives in `openengine-cluster-server`'s transport-neutral `connection` core;
the NDJSON stdin/stdout binding remains in its `stdio` module. [`data-plane.md`](./data-plane.md)
specifies WebSocket framing, close codes, `$/cancelRequest`, and the hosted data-plane boundary.

## Method and framing

`watch({runId?, fromCursor?})` establishes a subscription and returns one normal JSON-RPC result,
`{subscriptionId, runId?, atCursor?}`. `runId` and `atCursor` are both null while the subscription
is parked (no run has resolved because `runId` was omitted and there is no current run). Otherwise,
`atCursor` is the
coherent tail cursor captured at subscription establishment.

Subscription delivery uses generic framing shared with other subscription methods, such as `logs`
and `agent/attach`. It does not use method-specific wire names:

- server notification `event`: carries `EventNotification{subscriptionId, runId, cursor, event}`;
- client notification `subscription/cancel`: carries `SubscriptionCancelParams{subscriptionId}`;
- terminal server notification `subscription/closed`: carries
  `SubscriptionClosedNotification{subscriptionId, reason, lastDeliveredCursor?}`.

There is no `watch/event`, `watch/cancel`, or `watch/closed` method on the wire. `watch` itself
returns exactly one JSON-RPC response for its request ID; every subsequent item is a notification.

## Event algebra

`Cursor` is an opaque string; it carries no sequence number, offset, or timestamp ordering key on
the wire. `WatchEvent` is a closed, tagged (`type`) enum:

- `phase{status, admission?}`: folds the observable cluster status (admission commit, update,
  suspend/resume, stop-request). The admission transition (`admission.runId/spec/seedInput`) is
  present only on the event that also commits the run.
- `node_begin{node, input}` / `node_end{node, outcome}`: a structured `NodeAddress{node, attempt}`
  plus verified input or a normalized `WorkerOutcome`. This is a testkit-only synthetic hook for
  golden vectors; it is not derived from node dispatch because no native graph executor exists
  yet.
- `bookmark`: advances the cursor with no public fold change (internal dispatch/lease turn
  bookkeeping).
- `fault{fault}`: a durable, closed, bounded, backend-neutral `BackendFault` projection (bounded
  code, consequence, retry disposition, action, severity, engine-owned summary, safe source
  frames, and opaque event identity). It correlates to the enclosing `EventNotification.runId`
  plus its own optional opaque `executionRef`; retry disposition and action are descriptive only
  and never authorize a retry. Emission does not change terminal semantics; it folds to
  no public status change, exactly like `bookmark`. Raw messages, paths, URLs, headers, commands,
  provider codes, credentials, session IDs, and arbitrary maps are unrepresentable. Native
  `EngineFault` mapping is outside this contract, as are the synthetic `node_begin` and `node_end`
  hooks.
- `finished{finalStatus, stopMode?}`: always the last event for a run.

A continuous watch from a run's first cursor through its `finished` event, after `(runId, cursor)`
deduplication, folds to the same public state as an authoritative `get` at the same cursor.

## At-least-once delivery and reconnect

Delivery is at-least-once: the same physical `(runId, cursor)` record may be redelivered (for
example after a slow-consumer reconnect). Duplicates are legal; the Rust client
(`ReconnectingEventStream`) deduplicates by `(runId, cursor)` before yielding an event, and that
dedup set survives reconnect.

Each subscription has a bounded live-delivery queue (`DEFAULT_SUBSCRIPTION_QUEUE_CAPACITY = 1024`
by default). Overflow closes only that subscription with
`subscription/closed{reason: "SLOW_CONSUMER", lastDeliveredCursor}`; the server records
`lastDeliveredCursor` only for an event actually yielded by the in-process stream or written by the
transport, never from a caller-supplied acknowledgement. Reconnecting with
`watch({runId, fromCursor: lastDeliveredCursor})` replays from that cursor (inclusive) through the
current tail with no gap, then switches to live delivery; client-side dedup removes the
redelivered boundary event. Cancelling a subscription (dropping the client's watch handle, or
`subscription/cancel`) only removes that subscription's live-delivery registration; it never
mutates admission or lifecycle cluster state.

## Snapshot-tail handoff

Subscription establishment is atomic: resolve the requested run (explicit `runId`, or the current
run when omitted), capture the coherent retained replay tail, and register live delivery, all under
one store critical section. No event committed after that section releases can fall in a gap
between the captured tail and the first live-delivered event. Replay from the requested cursor
through the captured tail is then read in bounded pages (never the whole retained suffix at once);
live events remain bounded by the subscription's queue and are delivered strictly after replay, in
cursor order.

`get.atCursor` is null for empty state; `watch({fromCursor: null})` with no current run parks and
attaches to the next committed run. An explicit `fromCursor` that never appears in the resolved
run's retained history, or an explicit unknown `runId`, returns `NOT_FOUND`.

## Retained history and deletion boundary

Per-run history is retained across supersession by a new run until an explicit tombstone. A
tombstoned run returns `GONE` from `watch`; a superseded but non-tombstoned run remains watchable
by explicit `runId`. This contract sets no implicit retention limit or automatic expiry.
Delete/retention semantics are outside its scope; the testkit's `tombstone_run` helper marks that
boundary.

## Fixture boundary

`InMemoryAdmissionStore` in the testkit is a deterministic, in-process fixture: retained history
and live subscriber fan-out live entirely in process memory behind one store mutex, purely for
conformance testing. It is not a production ledger, does not persist across process restarts, and
its `node_begin`/`node_end` and `emit_fault_event` golden-vector hooks are synthetic. They do not
exercise native graph execution or backend fault reporting. A native ledger's `ObservationStore`
projection is outside this contract and consumes these wire types unchanged.
