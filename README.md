**The agent that wrote the code shouldn't be the one that says it works.**

Zeroshot is an open-source, multi-agent orchestration engine for autonomous software engineering. It drives a coding agent you already run (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, or OpenCode) through an **executor-verifier loop**: an agent writes the change, then an _independent_ verifier that never saw how it was made approves it, or hands back a reproducible failure. The loop runs until the change is verified.

<div align="center">

  <em>One run, drawn as it happens. A conductor scores the issue, escalates what it can't call, the router sizes the cluster, and the change is rejected once before it is approved.</em>
</div>

## Install

<!-- install-placeholder -->

```bash
npm install -g @the-open-engine/zeroshot
```

Requires **Node ≥ 22** and at least one provider CLI (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, or OpenCode). The package includes the pinned Opcore constraints CLI; repository hook activation remains explicit. Linux and macOS today; Windows is deferred.

  <br>
  <em>And here it is actually running. Unattended, 100× speed · 90-minute run · 5 iterations to approval.</em>
</div>

## How it works

Zeroshot separates the agent that **writes** the code from the agent that **judges** it.

A conductor sizes the workflow to the task. An executor (an AI coding agent) implements the change in an isolated workspace (git worktree or Docker). Then an **independent verifier** inspects the result without ever seeing the executor's context or history, so it cannot approve its own reasoning. The verifier returns `APPROVED`, or `REJECTED` with an actionable, reproducible failure, and the loop repeats until the change is verified or hands back a concrete reason it isn't. Every step is written to a crash-safe SQLite ledger, so a run survives a reboot and resumes where it stopped.

Bring your own provider and your own backend. Zeroshot orchestrates the agents that write your code; it doesn't store your keys or replace your models.

## How is this different from a single coding agent?

|                             | A single coding agent        | Zeroshot                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who says it is correct?     | the same agent that wrote it | a separate agent that never saw how it was written                                          |
| Is the code actually run?   | usually just claimed         | executed against your real tests                                                            |
| When it fails, you get      | an assertion it is fine      | a reproducible failure                                                                      |
| When does it stop?          | when it decides it is done   | when the change is verified, or provably is not                                             |
| Which coding agent runs it? | one, fixed                   | any you already run: Zeroshot is the harness around Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, or OpenCode |

## Quick start

```bash
zeroshot run 123                 # a GitHub issue number
zeroshot run feature.md          # a markdown spec
zeroshot run "Add a --json flag" # inline text
```

Describe a non-trivial task inline and let the loop run it to a verified change:

```bash
zeroshot run "Add optimistic locking with automatic retry: when updating a user,
retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times, merge non-conflicting field changes,
and surface conflicts with details. Handle the ABA problem where version goes A->B->A."
```

## Hosted capsule runs

Named Zero Cloud targets use the same issue, file, stdin, and prompt inputs as local runs. Login
uses the device flow and stores only the rotating refresh token in the OS credential service. The
CLI resolves a target's provider runtime for each run and submits it inside a versioned opaque
RunIntent. Zero Cloud durably queues the encrypted payload, admits it when entitlement is
available, provisions the capsule, and forwards it to the in-capsule Zeroshot server. The CLI may
disconnect without cancelling; `zeroshot target status <target> <intent> --follow` reconnects to
the durable run. A runtime can select any provider supported by local Zeroshot and can carry
arbitrary environment variables, settings, files, a setup command, and an executable wrapper.

Create a target runtime JSON file. String environment and text-file values are literal;
`{"from":"X"}` reads an environment variable or local text file when the run starts. Local file
references are anchored to the runtime JSON's directory. Relative destination paths are
materialized below the capsule's private home directory. `setupCommand` runs once after those files
are installed. `command` is optional and provides a fallback wrapper for the executable expected by
the selected provider when that executable is not already available from the setup or base image.

Treat runtime configuration as trusted executable configuration. `setupCommand`, `command`, and
the selected harness can disclose the credentials available to their process just as a local
harness can. They do not gain access to another capsule through this mechanism.

For example, Claude Code through OpenRouter can be configured as:

```json
{
  "provider": "claude",
  "model": "sonnet",
  "setupCommand": "npm install --global --prefix \"$HOME/.local\" @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.220",
  "environment": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://openrouter.ai/api",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": { "from": "OPENROUTER_API_KEY" },
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL": "~anthropic/claude-sonnet-latest",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL": "~anthropic/claude-sonnet-latest",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL": "~anthropic/claude-sonnet-latest",
    "CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL": "~anthropic/claude-sonnet-latest"
  },
  "files": {},
  "settings": {}
}
```

A Codex runtime can instead supply its ordinary local configuration without any capsule-side
OpenRouter knowledge:

```json
{
  "provider": "codex",
  "model": "gpt-5.4",
  "setupCommand": "npm install --global --prefix \"$HOME/.local\" @openai/codex@0.146.0",
  "environment": {
    "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": { "from": "OPENROUTER_API_KEY" },
    "CODEX_HOME": "/workspace/.zeroshot-runtime/.codex"
  },
  "files": {
    ".codex/config.toml": { "from": "~/.codex/config.toml" }
  },
  "settings": {}
}
```

The bundled `gateway` provider needs no harness installation and can target any compatible OpenAI
or Anthropic endpoint through `providerSettings.gateway`.

```bash
zeroshot target add production --url https://cloud.example \
  --runtime-config ~/.zeroshot/cloud/claude-openrouter.json
zeroshot target login production

export GH_TOKEN=...                 # optional when `gh auth token` works
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
zeroshot run org/repo#123 --target production --pr
```

Use `--detach` to return after the queue accepts the run. The CLI prints the intent ID and exact
status command needed to reconnect. `zeroshot target cancel <target> <intent>` requests
cancellation independently of any attached CLI process.

`--provider` and `--model` override the target runtime's defaults. A provider override does not
inherit the original provider's model or executable wrapper, but it still uses that target's setup
command, environment, and files. Use separate named targets when harnesses need different runtime
configuration. Only the selected provider's explicit settings are uploaded; unrelated local
Zeroshot settings are not copied. Environment and file mappings are resolved afresh for every run,
so the CLI remains authoritative. Literal environment, file, and settings values are accepted
intentionally. `HOME`, `PATH`, `TMPDIR`, Git/GitHub authentication variables, and Zeroshot's hosted
control variables are reserved so runtime configuration cannot replace capsule isolation or
repository authentication.

Targets created without `--runtime-config` remain readable and usable for login and target
management, but cannot start capsule runs. Remove and re-add them with runtime configuration first.

`--size tiny|small|standard|large` selects the capsule tier; it is optional and defaults to
`standard`.

`--pr` runs in an isolated worktree, pushes the implementation branch, creates a pull request for
human review, verifies that GitHub reports it, and prints the pull request URL. Without `--pr`, the
hosted run does not push repository changes.

For one-shot non-interactive automation, `ZEROSHOT_TARGET_REFRESH_TOKEN` supplies a process-only
login and is never written to the target metadata file. Because Zero Cloud rotates refresh tokens,
repeat runs should use the persistent Secret Service login rather than reusing that environment
value.

## Providers and backends

Zeroshot shells out to provider CLIs; it stores no API keys and manages no auth. Pick a default and override per run.

| Provider     | CLI                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code  | `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`   |
| OpenAI Codex | `npm i -g @openai/codex`               |
| Gemini CLI   | `npm i -g @google/gemini-cli`          |
| OpenCode     | see [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai) |

```bash
zeroshot providers                    # see what's installed
zeroshot providers set-default codex
zeroshot run 123 --provider gemini
```

Issue backends are **auto-detected from your git remote**: **GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Azure DevOps**. Paste a number, key, or URL:

```bash
zeroshot run 123                                              # GitHub
zeroshot run https://gitlab.com/org/repo/-/issues/456        # GitLab
zeroshot run PROJ-789                                         # Jira
zeroshot run https://dev.azure.com/org/project/_workitems/edit/999  # Azure DevOps
```

Each backend needs its own CLI installed (`gh`, `glab`, `jira`, or `az`). See [`docs/providers.md`](docs/providers.md) for model levels and setup.

## Isolation

By default, agents modify files only; they do **not** commit or push. Opt into isolation to let the loop own a branch (the flags cascade: `--ship` → `--pr` → `--worktree`).

| Mode         | Flag         | Use when                                         |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| None         | _(default)_  | quick task, you review the changes yourself      |
| Git worktree | `--worktree` | PR workflows, lightweight branch isolation       |
| Docker       | `--docker`   | risky experiments, parallel runs, full isolation |

<details>
<summary><strong>Docker credential mounts</strong></summary>

When using `--docker`, Zeroshot mounts credential directories so agents can reach provider CLIs and tools. Defaults: `gh`, `git`, `ssh`. Presets include `aws`, `azure`, `kube`, `terraform`, `gcloud`, and the provider configs.

```bash
zeroshot settings set dockerMounts '["gh","git","ssh","aws"]'
zeroshot run 123 --docker --mount ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro
zeroshot run 123 --docker --no-mounts
```

See [`docs/providers.md`](docs/providers.md) for mount details.

</details>

## Scope and status

Zeroshot performs best when a task has **clear acceptance criteria**. If you can't say what "done" means, an independent verifier can't confirm it.

| Task                                            | Good fit? | Why                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| Add rate limiting (sliding window, per-IP, 429) | Yes       | clear requirements      |
| Refactor auth to JWT                            | Yes       | defined end state       |
| Fix a login bug                                 | Yes       | success is measurable   |
| "Make the app faster"                           | No        | needs exploration first |
| "Improve the codebase"                          | No        | no acceptance criteria  |

- **Pre-1.0 in spirit.** Interfaces still move between releases; pin your version. (The npm version auto-increments on every merge, so read it as a build counter, not a stability promise.)
- **Crash-safe.** All state persists to a SQLite ledger; `zeroshot resume <id>` continues at any time.
- **No TUI in this release.** Monitor with `zeroshot logs <id> -f`, `zeroshot list`, and `zeroshot status <id>`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Architecture, quality gates and command proofs</strong></summary>

Zeroshot is a message-driven coordination layer: a conductor classifies each task by complexity and type, a workflow template selects agents and validators, agents publish results to a SQLite ledger, and validators approve or reject with specific findings.

- **Required handoff quality gates**: in `--pr`/`--ship` flows, the git-pusher fails closed until every configured gate has fresh passing evidence.
- **Cmdproof**: make expensive exact commands reusable across agents with `zeroshot cmdproof check <id>`.

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for the cluster schema, primitives, and the conductor's classification model.

</details>

## The Open Engine

Zeroshot is **Layer 01 · Verification** of [The Open Engine](https://theopenengine.com), the open stack for autonomous software production. Generating code is easy; trusting it is not. The engine is layered because trust is layered:

|        | Layer                      | Status                      |
| ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **01** | **Verification: Zeroshot** | This repo · open · shipping |
| 02     | Constraints: **Opcore**    | Sibling · alpha             |
| 03-05  | Intent · Context · Runtime | In development              |

Zeroshot runs the loop: an agent writes the change, and an **independent** verifier decides whether it holds: approve, or a reproducible failure. **Opcore** is the sibling layer, a deterministic, local, read-only **constraints** gate for coding agents. Zeroshot packages Opcore `0.2.1` and uses introduced-change validation so existing repository debt never blocks an otherwise clean change. Verification asks _"does this meet the goal?"_; constraints ask _"is this within tolerance?"_

Each layer ships the same way: extracted from the platform we run, then opened. **Trust nothing. Verify everything.**
