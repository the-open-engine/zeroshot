/**
 * Single source of truth for "is this PID actually alive?"
 *
 * Previously this check was reimplemented separately in src/orchestrator.js
 * (_isProcessRunning) and lib/detached-startup.js (isProcessAlive), plus an
 * inline copy in _getActiveClustersForIssue. Four of those call sites agreed
 * on the answer; the resume() eligibility guard trusted persisted cluster
 * state instead of asking the OS, which is what let a dead-PID cluster be
 * simultaneously reported as "zombie" by status and "still running" by
 * resume. Consolidating avoids a sixth call site reintroducing that split.
