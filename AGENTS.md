# Zeroshot: Multi-Agent Coordination Engine

Operational rules and references for automated agents working on this repo. Install:
`npm i -g @the-open-engine/zeroshot` or `npm link` (dev).

## CRITICAL RULES

- Never spawn without permission. Do not run `zeroshot run <id>` unless the user explicitly asks to run it.
- Never use git in validator prompts. Validate files directly.
- Never ask questions. Agents run non-interactively; make autonomous decisions.
- Never edit `CLAUDE.md` unless explicitly asked to update docs.
- Detached (`-d`) runs must forward all `zeroshot run` options via `ZEROSHOT_RUN_OPTIONS` (see `buildDaemonEnv` + `buildStartOptions`) so PR/worktree config cannot be dropped.

Worker git operations are allowed only with isolation (`--worktree`, `--docker`, `--pr`, `--ship`). They are forbidden without isolation.

Read-only safe commands: `zeroshot list`, `zeroshot status`, `zeroshot logs`

Destructive commands (need permission): `zeroshot kill`, `zeroshot clear`, `zeroshot purge`

Cluster Protocol Rust types are the source of truth. Files under
`protocol/openengine-cluster/v1/` are generated projections; update them with
`cargo run -p openengine-cluster-testkit --bin generate-cluster-protocol -- --write` and
verify byte-for-byte drift with `npm run protocol:check`. These generator-formatted artifacts
are excluded from Prettier; never format them independently.
The protocol and server crates own wire contracts, backend traits, the dispatcher, and transports.
`zeroshot-rust/` owns the concrete `NativeBackend`, product-local `NativeBackendFactory`
construction root, product-private artifact byte-store port/local CAS, and product-private,
secret-free issue/source provider contracts. Artifact stages, bytes, roots, filesystem paths,
locks, and manifests remain product-private; only verified protocol `ArtifactRef` receipts cross
the engine boundary. `LocalCasArtifactStore` takes an explicit root, is a single-writer local
filesystem store, and must preserve ref-first release plus synchronized blob-then-ref publication.
Issue and source registries and identifiers remain independent; neither is a worker/model provider.
Keep protocol, transport, daemon, compatibility, adapter, credential resolution, ledger, and
workspace behavior outside it.
`ExecutionRuntime`, `LocalExecutionRuntime`, `LocalProcessRunner`, and the daemon-scoped fair
scheduler are engine-private seams. They own local dispatch placement, fencing, deadlines,
workspace conflict arbitration, cancellation, and local-process containment only. They do not own
ledger mutation, durable attempt state, protocol methods, provider catalog/configuration,
credential resolution, workspace lifecycle, real CLI/ACP/Gateway drivers, built-in registration,
or `NativeBackend` composition. Runtime command/control values remain serializable, secret-free,
and input-free after control reconstruction.
Native engine faults must be constructed only by `FaultFactory` from closed `ModuleEvidence`.
Decoded faults must match the canonical semantics derived from their required primary source frame.
Raw diagnostic values are replaced wholesale with typed markers and remain ephemeral; never put
them in `EngineFault`, observations, protocol responses, persistence, or exports. Observability is
injected through `ObservationSink` and uses only the fixed metrics and closed dimensions in
`observability.rs`; retry disposition is descriptive data, not retry authorization. Do not install
global telemetry state or caller-defined labels.
`ClusterLedger` is the only native durable domain authority. Its closed/versioned record algebra,
identity allocation, replay, lifecycle/CAS/idempotency rules, and safe-fault consequences stay
above the backend-neutral `LedgerStore` port. Control and verified I/O share one ordered hash
chain and transaction. Semantic validation and append CAS use the same folded position/hash; never
reread a newer prefix while committing payloads derived from an older one. Every committed mutation
ends in a hash-chained `MutationReceipt` record that exactly matches its atomic idempotency
projection, so missing or forged projection rows fail replay. Matching receipt retries return an
explicit replay outcome; receipt equality cannot distinguish a new commit from a concurrent
identical retry. `SqliteLedgerStore` is the sole v1 production store. SQLite creation initializes
a private same-directory database and atomically publishes the digest-named path, so losing
creators never remove the winning resource. Projections are
rebuildable and may not become a second journal. Persist only canonical engine records, verified
I/O, safe faults, effect intent/reconciliation, and cleanup receipts—never provider sessions,
reasoning, tools, raw diagnostics, stdout, or stderr.
Initial resource creation and its owner fence are one store operation. Guarded appends check
cancellation inside the store transaction immediately before their first write, after idempotent
receipt lookup. SQLite removal leaves an explicit empty tombstone until file unlink; missing live
metadata without that tombstone is corruption and must never authorize replacement.
Graph syntax, payload subtyping, compiled IR, diagnostics, and artifact receipt Rust types remain
authoritative protocol contracts. `ProductionGraphVerifier` is the one reusable production
semantic verifier for `openengine.graph.full/v1`; it resolves workers through `WorkerRegistry` and
adds proven `StructuralBounds` without replacing the authoritative AST/IR. It does not admit,
store, schedule, or execute graphs. `ScriptedVerifier` remains a test-only admission fixture.
Full-v1 ceilings are fixed public constants beside `ProductionGraphVerifier`, not product
configuration. Node timeouts use the wire `PositiveInteger` range and have no 24-hour verifier
ceiling.
Full-v1 finite control enumeration couples each executable's signals and error as mutually
exclusive outcomes, including per-item map aggregates. Choice residual assignments govern output
channel availability; terminal alternatives do not flow into later nodes. Mapped control flow
preserves per-item execution correlation: guaranteed sequential, full-completion parallel, and
do-while descendants emit an outcome, while conditional descendants emit one exactly on their
selected residual route. An `otherwise` node is illegal when earlier branches exhaust the legal
control space and is excluded from flow analysis.
`k_of_n` and `k_of_map` labels never widen their selectors' closed domains. Executable writes
remain success-conditional until residual control excludes every runtime error; state reads and
promotions preserve that outcome provenance. Definition flow carries exact path/type guarantees
from required initial input through nested groups. A successful output/diagnostic binding defines
only its required selected path and required descendants, never optional producer paths.
V1 has no whole-payload binding: executable inputs and `succeed` outputs must be `null` or records.
Scalar, enum, and array payloads remain valid in other algebra positions and as nested record
fields. A map body write to a promoted `array<T>` path writes one `T` at the current input index;
the result is input-ordered and total, with empty input defining `[]`, while mapped executable
success/error provenance remains until control excludes every mapped runtime error.
Parallel continuation requires all branches for `all`, one for `any`/`first`, and `count` for
`quorum`; quorum flow and promotions are guaranteed only when present in every jointly satisfiable
size-`count` completion set. Shared guard correlations can make independently possible branch
completions mutually exclusive and must be preserved during that analysis. Correlate
`joined=reached|quorum_unreachable` for `all`/`any`/`quorum` with the required branch-completion
predicate; mapped join controls retain that correlation with branch controls per item before their
counts are aggregated. Impossible status/control combinations are excluded from guard analysis. Parallel failure labels
`quorum_unreachable` and `no_satisfier` restore the incoming pre-par definitions and expose no
winner or branch-promotion data. Unguarded continuation cannot consume success-only parallel
writes. Preserve target-granular conditional ownership through nested parallels, choice merges,
and later sequential writers; descendant writes must invalidate stale ancestor type facts.
For `first`, only a completing branch that guarantees the controls read by `when` and satisfies the
predicate is a winner; correlate `raced=satisfied|no_satisfier` with those winner assignments.
The admission coordinator provides stateful plan/apply/get semantics through injected ports.
Testkit scripted approval and `running` phase mean admitted state, not native verification or a
production full-graph executor.
Authoritative admission snapshots fail closed: `empty` has no durable fields, `running` has the
complete matching control/seed tuple, and transient `admitting` preserves one of those two shapes.
Operational suspend is a dispatch gate: existing leases may land verified I/O, but successors wait
for resume. Drain waits without inventing graph hooks; force cancels and voids leases without
fabricating output. Each stopped run has one final `finished` event. Stop acknowledgements never
claim rollback or absence of external side effects. These are deterministic scripted-backend
semantics, not a native graph scheduler or worker executor.

The TUI is not included in this release. Use `zeroshot list`, `zeroshot status <id>`,
and `zeroshot logs <id> -f` or `zeroshot logs <id> -w` for monitoring.

### Cluster Worker Contracts

| Concept                    | File                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Worker descriptors         | `crates/openengine-cluster-protocol/src/worker.rs`         |
| Normalized worker outcomes | `crates/openengine-cluster-protocol/src/worker/outcome.rs` |
| Worker registry boundary   | `crates/openengine-cluster-server/src/worker_registry.rs`  |
| Mock worker profiles       | `crates/openengine-cluster-testkit/src/worker_profiles.rs` |

Worker descriptors and registry compatibility checks are contract/pre-admission ports only.
ACP/A2A modules in the testkit are mock conformance profiles, never production transports.
Descriptors must declare all four closed runtime errors (`timeout`, `crash`, `malformed`, `refusal`).
The reserved legacy descriptor is valid only with its canonical request/result payload types, while
mock verifier completions must validate output, signals, diagnostics, and artifacts before emission.
Worker JSON Schema must mirror descriptor cross-field/uniqueness validation and the closed
error-code/reason matrix; registry compatibility must reject verifier contracts on step nodes.

The legacy cluster worker is the bounded Node implementation of `legacy.zeroshot.ship@1`.
Its public facade is exactly `start`, `status`, `events`, `stop`, and `result`; do not add
guidance, permission callbacks, writable attach, raw output, credential fields, or caller launch
flags. Registry resolution must produce a frozen worktree/docker plan before engine allocation.
Lifecycle and terminal truth comes from cluster records plus durable ledger topics; PID state is
diagnostic only. Explicit stop is bounded by the registry shutdown deadline and never claims that
provider or tool side effects were rolled back.
Completion events require a canonical result or explicit bounded summary, and failure events require
a valid closed code/reason pair; missing or corrupt terminal data fails as `malformed`. Engine status
observation is synchronous and fails closed when durable truth cannot be read.
Profile resolution, artifact staging, engine start, and receipt collection remain cancellable under
the registry execution bound; stop may win before engine allocation. A caller shutdown deadline
bounds stop acknowledgement, not cleanup ownership: the engine adapter must still stop a cluster
that allocates late while start remains pending, then release its orchestrator exactly once so
process EOF cannot retain engine handles. The executable may wait for that cleanup only until its
own shutdown deadline; at the deadline it invokes the internal release port and exits.
Artifact input has no echo-only default resolver. The current engine allocates isolation first,
then runs the injected resolver before agents start; the resolver must materialize read-only content
inside that workspace. Cancelled profile, staging, and receipt operations retain late cleanup
ownership through their injected `release`/`cleanup` hooks. Late operation and cleanup failures must
reach the cleanup-failure reporter (default: process warning); never detach them with an empty catch.

## CLI Quick Reference

```bash
# Flag cascade: --ship -> --pr -> --worktree
zeroshot run 123                  # Local, no isolation
zeroshot run 123 --worktree       # Git worktree isolation
zeroshot run 123 --pr             # Worktree + create PR
zeroshot run 123 --pr --pr-base dev # PR base: dev, worktree base: origin/dev (incl. -d)
zeroshot run 123 --ship           # Worktree + PR + auto-merge
zeroshot run 123 --docker         # Docker container isolation
zeroshot run 123 -d               # Background (daemon) mode

# Management
zeroshot list                     # All clusters (--json)
zeroshot status <id>              # Cluster details
zeroshot logs <id> [-f|-w]        # Stream logs
zeroshot resume <id> [prompt]     # Resume failed cluster
zeroshot stop <id>                # Graceful stop
zeroshot kill <id>                # Force kill

# Utilities
zeroshot export <id>              # Export conversation
zeroshot agents list              # Available agents
zeroshot settings                 # View/modify settings
zeroshot providers                # Provider status and defaults
```

UX modes:

- Foreground (`zeroshot run`): streams logs, Ctrl+C stops cluster.
- Daemon (`-d`): background, Ctrl+C detaches.
- Attach (`zeroshot attach`): connect to daemon, Ctrl+C detaches only.

Settings: `defaultProvider`, `providerSettings` (claude/codex/gateway/gemini/opencode/pi/copilot), legacy `maxModel`, `defaultConfig`, `logLevel`, robustness (`maxRetries`, `backoffBaseMs`, `backoffMaxMs`, `jitterFactor`, `maxRestartAttempts`, `maxTotalRestarts`, `staleWarningsBeforeKill`).

Provider engines are registry-owned: adding an engine means one entry in `src/agent-cli-provider/provider-registry.ts`, plus the provider-specific adapter and tests. Docker credential mount/env presets, CLI aliases, visible preset lists, and any nontrivial availability probe rules must derive from that registry entry; do not add new provider identity lists or provider preset lists elsewhere.
Model gateways stay behind the single bundled `gateway` engine. Do not add `openrouter`, `ollama`, `vllm`, `hermes`, or similar model-only targets as standalone provider ids.

ACP-native engines use one shared stdio adapter lane. New ACP engines must be added with registry metadata plus helper fixtures only; do not add engine-specific ACP parsers or invoke runners.
ACP fixtures must use protocol-shaped chunk payloads: `agent_message_chunk.content` is a single `ContentBlock` object, and thought deltas are covered with `agent_thought_chunk` fixtures so parser tests catch spec drift.

## Architecture

Pub/sub message bus + SQLite ledger. Agents subscribe to topics, execute on trigger match, publish results.

```
Agent A -> publish() -> SQLite Ledger -> LogicEngine -> trigger match -> Agent B executes
```

Restart persistence: orchestrator publishes `AGENT_RESTART_ATTEMPT` to the ledger so restart limits survive orchestrator restarts.

Provider task ownership: task watchers persist an owned termination boundary with each active task.
POSIX providers run in a dedicated process group; Windows providers use the exact root PID with
`taskkill /T`. Recovery must terminate that recorded boundary before retrying work.

### Guidance Messaging

- Topics: `USER_GUIDANCE_CLUSTER`, `USER_GUIDANCE_AGENT` (see `src/guidance-topics.js`).
- Mailbox helper: `ledger.queryGuidanceMailbox()` with `messageBus.queryGuidanceMailbox()` passthrough.
- Live injection: `Orchestrator.sendGuidanceToAgent()` uses `agent.injectInput()` to attempt PTY stdin; always persists `USER_GUIDANCE_AGENT` with `metadata.delivery` (`status: injected|unsupported`, `method: pty`, `taskId`, `reason`).
- Safe-point queue fallback: `AgentWrapper._buildContext()` pulls queued guidance via `collectQueuedGuidance()` and injects a delimited block in `agent-context-builder` between Instructions and Output Schema. Cursor: `agent.lastGuidanceAppliedAt`.

### Agent Configuration (Minimal)

```json
{
  "id": "worker",
  "role": "implementation",
  "modelLevel": "level2",
  "triggers": [{ "topic": "ISSUE_OPENED", "action": "execute_task" }],
  "prompt": "Implement the requested feature...",
  "hooks": {
    "onComplete": {
      "action": "publish_message",
      "config": { "topic": "IMPLEMENTATION_READY" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Provider Model Levels

- Use `modelLevel` (`level1`/`level2`/`level3`) for provider-agnostic configs.
- Set `provider` per agent or `defaultProvider`/`forceProvider` at cluster level.
- Provider names use CLI identifiers: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `pi`, `copilot` (legacy `anthropic`/`openai`/`google` map to these).
- `model` remains a provider-specific escape hatch.
- Claude/Codex/Opencode only: `reasoningEffort` (`low|medium|high|xhigh|max`).

### Logic Script API

```javascript
// Ledger (auto-scoped to cluster)
ledger.query({ topic, sender, since, limit });
ledger.findLast({ topic });
ledger.count({ topic });

// Cluster
cluster.getAgents();
cluster.getAgentsByRole('validator');

// Helpers
helpers.allResponded(agents, topic, since);
helpers.hasConsensus(topic, since);
```

Context strategies now support `since: 'last_agent_start'` to scope history to the most recent
iteration start for the executing agent. Acceptable values: `cluster_start`, `last_task_end`,
`last_agent_start`, or an ISO timestamp string.

## Conductor: 2D Classification

Classifies tasks on Complexity x TaskType, routes to parameterized templates.

| Complexity | Description            | Validators |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| TRIVIAL    | 1 file, mechanical     | 0          |
| SIMPLE     | 1 concern              | 1          |
| STANDARD   | Multi-file             | 3          |
| CRITICAL   | Auth/payments/security | 5          |

| TaskType | Action                |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| INQUIRY  | Read-only exploration |
| TASK     | Implement new feature |
| DEBUG    | Fix broken code       |

Base templates: `single-worker`, `worker-validator`, `debug-workflow`, `full-workflow`.

## Isolation Modes

| Mode     | Flag         | Use When                                           |
| -------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Worktree | `--worktree` | Quick isolated work, PR workflows                  |
| Docker   | `--docker`   | Full isolation, risky experiments, parallel agents |

Worktree: lightweight git branch isolation (<1s setup).
Docker: fresh git clone in container, credentials mounted, auto-cleanup.

## Docker Mount Configuration

Configurable credential mounts for `--docker` mode. See `lib/docker-config.js`.

| Setting                | Type          | Default  | Description                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `dockerMounts`         | `Array<string | object>` | `['gh','git','ssh']`                                  | Presets or `{host, container, readonly}` |
| `dockerEnvPassthrough` | `string[]`    | `[]`     | Extra env vars (supports `VAR`, `VAR_*`, `VAR=value`) |
| `dockerContainerHome`  | `string`      | `/root`  | Container home for `$HOME` expansion                  |

Mount presets: infrastructure presets plus provider ids from `src/agent-cli-provider/provider-registry.ts`.

Provider CLIs in Docker require credential mounts; Zeroshot warns when missing.

Env var syntax:

- `VAR` -> pass if set in host env
- `VAR_*` -> pass all matching (e.g., `TF_VAR_*`)
- `VAR=value` -> always set to value
- `VAR=` -> always set to empty string

Config priority: CLI flags > `ZEROSHOT_DOCKER_MOUNTS` env > settings > defaults.

```bash
# Persistent config
zeroshot settings set dockerMounts '["gh","git","ssh","aws"]'

# Per-run override
zeroshot run 123 --docker --mount ~/.custom:/root/.custom:ro

# Disable all mounts
zeroshot run 123 --docker --no-mounts
```

## Adversarial Tester (STANDARD+ only)

Core principle: tests passing != implementation works. The ONLY verification is: USE IT YOURSELF.

1. Read issue -> understand requirements
2. Look at code -> figure out how to invoke
3. Run it -> did it work?
4. Try to break it -> edge cases
5. Verify each requirement -> evidence (command + output)

## Persistence

| File                        | Content               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `~/.zeroshot/clusters.json` | Cluster metadata      |
| `~/.zeroshot/<id>.db`       | SQLite message ledger |

Clusters survive crashes. Resume: `zeroshot resume <id>`.

## Known Limitations

Bash subprocess output not streamed: Claude CLI returns `tool_result` after subprocess completes.
Long scripts show no output until done.

Strict structured-output Codex tasks use the attachable PTY watcher. Claude strict
structured-output tasks keep the non-PTY watcher because PTY notifications can be
interpreted as streaming commands; use `zeroshot logs` for those tasks.
Attach sockets use the shared short runtime namespace from `src/attach/socket-paths.js`;
never reconstruct their path from `HOME` in a watcher or client.

### Kubernetes / Network Storage (SQLite Ledger)

Zeroshot’s message ledger is SQLite (`~/.zeroshot/<id>.db`). On Kubernetes, putting this on a
network filesystem (EFS/NFS/CephFS) can cause severe latency and lock contention.

Mitigations (env vars):

- `ZEROSHOT_SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE=DELETE` (or `TRUNCATE`) for network filesystems that don’t like WAL
- `ZEROSHOT_SQLITE_WAL_AUTOCHECKPOINT_PAGES=1000` (default) to avoid per-write checkpoint storms
- `ZEROSHOT_SQLITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS=5000` (default) to reduce `SQLITE_BUSY` flakiness under contention

Operational rule: don’t run multiple pods against the same `~/.zeroshot` volume unless you
really know what you’re doing—SQLite is not a multi-writer, multi-node database.

## Fixed Bugs (Reference)

### Template Agent CWD Injection (2026-01-03)

Bug: `--ship` mode created worktree but template agents (planning, implementation, validator)
ran in main directory instead, polluting it with uncommitted changes.

Root cause: `_opAddAgents()` didn't inject cluster's worktree cwd into dynamically spawned
template agents. Initial agents got cwd via `startCluster()`, but template agents loaded
later via conductor classification missed it.

Fix: added cwd injection to `_opAddAgents()` and resume path in `orchestrator.js`.
Test: `tests/worktree-cwd-injection.test.js`.

### PR Mode Completion Hang (2026-01-15)

Bug: PR-mode clusters stayed running after PR creation/merge because no
`CLUSTER_COMPLETE` was ever published.

Root cause: `git-pusher` relied on `output.publishAfter` without an onComplete
hook, so the orchestrator never received the completion signal.

Fix: added `onComplete` publish of `CLUSTER_COMPLETE` in
`src/agents/git-pusher-agent.json`.
Test: `tests/integration/orchestrator-flow.test.js`.

### Foreground Resume Exit Delay (2026-07-17)

Bug: foreground `zeroshot resume` could print cluster completion but remain alive until a
five-second task-shutdown timer expired.

Root cause: agent shutdown raced in-flight execution against a bounded timeout without clearing the
losing timer, and the resume CLI omitted the foreground orchestrator cleanup used by `run`.

Fix: clear the bounded-wait timer, close non-daemon resume orchestrators in `finally`, and make
orchestrator close release snapshotter, message-bus, and ledger resources.
Tests: `tests/unit/agent-lifecycle-stop.test.js` and
`tests/e2e/resume-detach-daemon.test.js`.

## Enforcement Philosophy

**ENFORCE > DOCUMENT. If enforceable, don't document.**

Preference: Type system > ESLint > Pre-commit hook > Documentation

Error messages ARE the documentation. Write them with what + fix.

## Anti-Patterns (Zeroshot-Specific)

### 1. Running Zeroshot Without Permission

```bash
# ❌ FORBIDDEN
agent: "I'll run zeroshot on issue #123"
zeroshot run 123

# ✅ CORRECT
agent: "Would you like me to run zeroshot on issue #123?"
# Wait for user consent
```

WHY: Multi-agent runs consume significant API credits.

### 2. Git Commands in Validator Prompts

```bash
# ❌ FORBIDDEN
validator_prompt: "Run git diff to verify changes..."

# ✅ CORRECT
validator_prompt: "Read src/index.js and verify function exists..."
```

WHY: Multiple agents modify git state concurrently. Validator reads stale state.

### 3. Asking Questions in Autonomous Workflows

```javascript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN
await AskUserQuestion('Should I use approach A or B?');

// ✅ CORRECT
// Decision: Using approach A because requirement specifies X
```

WHY: Zeroshot agents run non-interactively.

### 4. Worker Git Operations Without Isolation

```bash
# ❌ FORBIDDEN
zeroshot run 123  # Pollutes main directory

# ✅ CORRECT
zeroshot run 123 --worktree  # Isolated
zeroshot run 123 --pr        # Worktree + PR
zeroshot run 123 --docker    # Full isolation
```

WHY: Prevents contamination, enables parallel work.

### 5. Using Git Stash

```bash
# ❌ FORBIDDEN
git stash  # Hides work from other agents

# ✅ CORRECT
git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: feature implementation"
git switch other-branch
```

WHY: WIP commits are visible, never lost, squashable.

## Behavioral Rules

### Git Workflow (Multi-Agent)

Use WIP commits instead of stashing:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: save work"  # Instead of git stash
git switch <branch>                            # Instead of git checkout
git restore <file>                             # Instead of git checkout --
```

### Test-First Workflow

Write tests BEFORE or WITH code:

```bash
touch src/new-feature.js
touch tests/new-feature.test.js  # FIRST
# Write failing tests → Implement → Pass
```

### Validation Workflow

Run validation for:

- Significant changes (>50 lines)
- Refactoring across files
- When user explicitly requests

Trust pre-commit hooks for trivial changes.
`npm run test:unit` uses a temporary home and settings path; operator settings must not affect it.

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test
```

Mocha config: `.mocharc.cjs` applies defaults; passing explicit `*.test.js` files on the CLI skips the default `tests/**/*.test.js` spec.
The Mocha bootstrap isolates unit tests from live `ZEROSHOT_*` run options and user settings;
tests must not depend on ambient cluster state or `~/.zeroshot/settings.json`.

Workers are now explicitly ordered to treat every `VALIDATION_RESULT` line as non-negotiable law before typing again. Failing to read and address each validator complaint before claiming completion will be rejected automatically.

## CI Failure Diagnosis

Multiple CI jobs fail → Diagnose each independently.

1. Get exact status: `gh api repos/the-open-engine/zeroshot/actions/runs/{RUN_ID}/jobs`
2. Read ACTUAL error: `gh api repos/the-open-engine/zeroshot/actions/jobs/{JOB_ID}/logs`
3. Fix ONE error → Push → Rerun → Repeat

## Release Pipeline Convention

- Dev required checks: `check` only (merge queue).
- Main required checks: `check` + `install-matrix` (merge queue).
- Cross-platform `install-matrix` runs in CI for main only.

Do NOT assume single root cause.

## CLAUDE.md Writing Rules

**Scope:** Narrowest possible.

**Content Priority:**

1. CRITICAL gotchas (caused real bugs)
2. "Where to Look" routing tables
3. Anti-patterns with WHY
4. Commands/troubleshooting

**DELETE:** Tutorial content, directory trees, interface definitions

**Format:** Tables over prose, ❌/✅ examples with WHY
